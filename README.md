## 👤 About This Repository

Welcome to the **Daily Code Journal** by [Your Full Name or Username: SequentialCode]!

This repository serves as a persistent, chronological log of my daily learning, development experiments, and deep dives into specific programming concepts. It is designed to track my progress, solidify understanding, and showcase my commitment to consistent development.

* **Primary Language:** C++ (with a focus on modern standards)
* **Key Focus Areas:** Concurrency, Data Structures, STL (Standard Template Library), Design Patterns, and System-Level Programming.
* **Goal:** Maintain a consistent learning cadence and provide clean, working examples for each topic explored.
