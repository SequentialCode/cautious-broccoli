# 🛠️ SequentialCode Daily Code Journal

## 👤 About This Repository

Welcome to the **Daily Code Journal** by SequentialCode!

This repository serves as a persistent, chronological log of my daily learning, development experiments, and deep dives into specific programming concepts. It is designed to track my progress, solidify understanding, and showcase my commitment to consistent development.

* **Primary Language:** C++ (with a focus on modern standards)
* **Key Focus Areas:** Concurrency, Data Structures, STL (Standard Template Library), Design Patterns, and System-Level Programming.
* **Goal:** Maintain a consistent learning cadence and provide clean, working examples for each topic explored.

## 📅 Table of Contents (Daily Entries)

This section links directly to the detailed documentation for each daily entry. The files are located within the `/Coding` directory.

## 🚀 How to Build and Run Projects

All projects are managed under a single Visual Studio Solution file.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SequentialCode/cautious-broccoli.git](https://github.com/SequentialCode/cautious-broccoli.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the Solution:**
    Navigate to the `Coding` folder and open the main solution file: `Coding/Coding.sln`.
3.  **Build:** In Visual Studio, set the desired project (e.g., `SharedVariableFolder`) as the startup project. Build the solution (`Ctrl + Shift + B`).
4.  **Run:** Execute the project (`F5` or `Ctrl + F5`).

### Key Changes Made:

1.  **Added Day 0002 Entry:** Included the new row in the Table of Contents, linking to the documentation for the Vowel Counter topic.
2.  **Date/Topic Update:** Used the date and topic from your Day 0002 entry (`2025-12-05`, `C++ Container and String Iteration`).
3.  **Contact Link Formalized:** Updated the LinkedIn link to use Markdown syntax for better presentation.
4.  **Order Adjustment (Optional but Recommended):** I placed **Day 0002** before Day 0001 in the table. Keeping the **most recent entry at the top** is a common practice for journals, allowing visitors to see your newest work first. (Feel free to revert this if you prefer strict chronological order).

You can now use this updated file for your next commit!
